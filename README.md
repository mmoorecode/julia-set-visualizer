The Mandelbrot set is a fractal generated by iterating the function f(z) = z^2 + c and determinining if the series of z's generated
converge or diverge
For every point C within the Mandelbrot set, there is a corresponding Julia set.  The Julia set is generated by holding C static and
iterating the function outlined above.

This program overlays the Julia set that corresponds to the point in the Mandelbrot set 
where C = the point that the mouse is currently hovering over.
